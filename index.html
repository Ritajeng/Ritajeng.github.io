<center><p class = "p1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.

Historically, people secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.

Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.

The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".</p></center>

<center><p class ="p3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;Some of you will remember the Sainsbury’s advertising campaign from the late 1980s. They all started with 'Take…’ and starred an ingredient that the supermarket wanted to go mainstream. The voiceover was sexy, the dish was easy to make.

These little recipes within adverts were brilliantly innovative. I freelanced for the agency behind the campaign, coming up with the dishes. But when they asked me to do one with crème fraîche I said, 'Nobody’s going to buy crème fraîche in this country!’ This is why I don’t now work in advertising. 

I had used crème fraîche when I lived in France but I didn’t think its main characteristic – the lovely tangy acidity that balances out its richness – would catch on here. </p><center>
